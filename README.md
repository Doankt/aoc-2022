# Doankt AOC-2022

My implementations for AOC-2022.

Most of the solutions in ```src/``` will be my first working implementations.
My thoughts on improvements for a day can be found under [SOLUTION_NOTES](SOLUTION_NOTES.md)

## Structure

```src/``` Contains solutions per day
```inputs/day{x}``` Contains two files in this dir. One for the actual input and one for test input.

## Notes Per Day {#notes}

Find notes about solutions here. This will also contain thoughts on what I would've like to done instead.
